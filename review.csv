i believe that these are the best looking longest wearing pants you will ever find i bought them for my nephew to wear in a very hot and greasy commercial kitchen hoping they would be as good as the dickie medical uniforms i used to wear to work in a hospital they came through with flying colors they wash and dry like a dream with no shrinkage very little fading and no wrinkles even after 10 or more times through the washer and dryer with my nephew mostly washing them in hot water i would highly recommend these pants to anyone
